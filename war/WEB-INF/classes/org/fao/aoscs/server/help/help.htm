<h3>Getting started</h3>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h4>About the Workbench</h4>

The AGROVOC workbench is the tool used to manage concepts, terms, schemes, and relationships between them in AGROVOC. AGROVOC is a multilingual structured thesaurus of all subject fields in Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Food security and related domains. 
<br>

<h4>Basic functionality</h4>

The Workbench is managed collaboratively among users with different roles. To understand how the Workbench functions, it is important to understand the distinction between concepts and terms.
<br><br>
Depending on your user role and privileges, you will be able to perform different actions in the Workbench.
<br><br>
Throughout the Workbench, you will see three types of square icons:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Square icons with [-]. Use this icon to delete the information it is associated with.</li><br>
<li>Square icons with [+]. Use this icon to add to the information you are viewing.</li><br>
<li>Square icons with a small pencil. Use this icon to edit information.</li><br>
</ol>
A legend also shows you the status and type of the content you are viewing.

<h4>Content</h4>

The following modules make up the content in the Workbench:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Search Module: use this module to search concepts, terms, relationships and other information.</li><br>
<li>Concepts module: use this module to browse for concepts and see associated terms and information. Also use this module to change, add or delete relationships between concepts and terms.</li><br>
<li>Relationships: use to manage the relationships in the ontology. To work with relationships between concepts and terms, use the Concepts Module. To work with relationships within schemes, use the Schemes Module. Full use of this module is available only for publishers and administrators.</li><br>
<li>Schemes: use this module to view and manage classifications and schemes and the relationships within them.</li><br>
<li>Validation: this module is for administrators, publishers, and validators to validate suggestions and changes made by other users.</li><br>
<li>Consistency: this module is used to perform quality control.</li><br>
<li>Export: this module is used to export data chosen by the user.</li><br>
<li>Statistics: this module is for administrators, publishers, and validators to view information on the amount and type of use on the Workbench.</li><br>
<li>Users: this module is for administrators, publishers, and validators to manage users.</li><br>
<li>Groups: allows administrators and other authorized users to manage groups.</li><br>
<li>Preferences: this module allows users to set viewing and language preferences.</li><br>
</ol>
<br>

<h4>Language</h4>

By default, all the terms associated with a concept appear when viewing a concept. You may wish to change the language settings during your use of the Workbench.
<br>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Language settings</h3>
If you wish to set languages for your current session only, use the "Customize language display" button at the top right of every page. If you wish to set preferences for future sessions, use the Preferences Module to set your preferred languages.
<br><br>

<h4>Language of interface</h4>

The interface - the information you see that does not include concepts, terms and relationships - is currently only available in English. More languages will be available soon and they will be available from the top of every page.
<br><br>

<h4>Language of the data</h4>

You can choose which languages you wish to see concepts displayed in. The full representation of a concept is all of the terms used to represent it, in all languages but reducing the number of languages displayed can make browsing concepts easier. 
<br><br>
You can choose in which language(s) you would like to see concepts displayed for the current session by selecting the "Customize language display" button at the top right of every page.
<br><br>

<h4>Adding languages to the Workbench</h4>

If you have permission to add languages to the Workbench, you can do this using the "Customize language display" button at the top right of every page.
<br>

<h3>Legend and icon overview<h3>

<h4>Denotion of concepts, terms and categories</h4>

<ul>
<li>A <b>light blue square</b> with an <b>R</b> denotes a <b>relationship</b></li><br>
<li>A <b>yellow square</b> with a <b>C</b> denotes a <b>concept</b></li><br>
<li>A <b>green square</b> with a <b>C</b> denotes a <b>category</b></li><br>
<li>A <b>blue square</b> with a <b>T</b> denotes a <b>term</b></li><br>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Status of the data</h4>

The legend for the status of concepts and terms and the relationships between them can be seen at the bottom of the Concepts, Schemes and Relationships Modules.
<br><br>
The following statuses are included in the legend: 
<br>
<b>Proposed (guest)</b>: a non-logged in, anonymous guest user has proposed a term that will be assessed by an authorized and registered validator.
<br>
<b>Proposed</b>: a registered user has proposed a change.
<br>
<b>Published</b>: a validated change has been approved and confirmed by a publisher and and is now a published part of the ontology.
<br>
<b>Validated</b>: a validator has approved the change. Once a publisher reviews it, it will become published.
<br>
<b>Revised (guest)</b>: a non-logged in, anonymous guest user has changed content that will be assessed by an authorized and registered validator.
<br>
<b>Revised</b>: a registered user has made a revision.
<br>
<b>Proposed deprecated</b>: a registered user has proposed to remove a concept or term.
<br>
<b>Deprecated</b>: a term or concept has been approved as being outdated.
<br>

<h3>User roles and privileges</h3>

<b>Note</b>: Please be aware that at the moment, above described user rights and permissions are only partly implemented. 
<br><br>
Users with different roles maintain the data in the workbench. 
<br><br>
All users are allowed to create, edit and delete concepts, terms and relationships. Their roles will determine how these actions appear to administrators:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The creation of a new term or concept will enter the system with the status 'proposed' or 'guest-proposed', depending on if you are a registered user or logged in on a guest account.</li><br>
<li>If a non-logged-in user deletes a concept, term or relationship, it will appear as 'proposed deprecated'.</li><br>
</ul>
All actions will be reassessed and validated by authorized registered validators and publishers.
<br><br>
The following are identified user roles. Click on the links to read more details about them.
<br>
<ol>
<li>Guests (non logged in users) can make suggestions for new terms and other suggestions about concepts and relationships, such as proposing to delete or change.</li><br>
<li>Term editors (terminologists) can manage the entire terminology base in their own language(s).</li><br>
<li>Ontology editors can manage concepts and relationships.</li><br>
<li>Validators can check (approve or reject) the changes done by the users in numbers 1-3 in this list. They can also approve new registered users.</li><br>
<li>Publishers are responsible for publishing the validated entities. Only published entities will appear in exports that are used for indexing and other purposes.</li><br>
<li>Super users (administrators) have full access to the system.</li><br>
</ol><br>
The implementation of different user roles is ongoing. The goal is to have a workflow with the status of data changes based on user actions.

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Guests (Non-logged in users)</h3>

Guests (non-logged in users) can perform the following actions:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Navigate or search the system.</li><br>
<li>Submit suggested terms in any language.</li><br>
<li>Other suggestions about concepts and relationships, such as proposing to delete or change.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>
All suggestions will be identified as “guest proposed” and will be assessed by an authorized and registered validator.
<br><br>
Most guest proposals will be visible as proposals made by guests in the system. However, proposed deletions or edits of existing terms and concepts will only show upon successful validation of a validator.
<br><br>
All suggestions made by these users should be associated with their IP address.
<br><br>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Term editors</h3>

Term editors include terminologists and thesaurus editors. The following describes their roles and privileges:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Full permissions on terms. which they own (i.e. created themselves).</li><br>
<li>Any changes in terms which they own, such as deleting or editing, will be published without additional validation through a validator.</li><br>
<li>Term editors who are the owner/creators of a term can delete it completely.</li><br>
<li>Any other changes term editors make in the system will be proposals that need to be validated.</li><br>
<li>Permission to create terms in his or her designated language(s) without additional validation.</li><br>
<li>Modifications on concepts and terms which they are not the owner of will be set as "proposed”.</li><br>
<li>Every term editor has set one or more working languages for themselves and can only add/edit/delete terms of that language. Edit access for other languages is restricted.</li><br>
<li>Editors can provide suggestions to more experienced users (e.g. concepts modifications that will be processed by ontology editors).</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Ontology editors</h3>

Ontology Editors include more experienced terminologists and thesaurus editors. The following describes their role:
<br>
<ul>
<li>They are terminologists/thesaurus editors familiar with ontologies and the distinction of concepts and terms.</li><br>
<li>They manage terms (of specific languages, i.e. the ontology editor's registered languages) and concepts.</li><br>
<li>They have permission to create and publish a new concept without further validation.</li><br>
<li>Only edits on concepts of which the ontology editor is not the owner will enter the system as proposed and will have to be validated.</li><br>
<li>If an ontology editor deletes a concept, only the terms of the corresponding languages will be set to “proposed deprecated” and the concept status will be set to “proposed deprecated”.</li><br> 
<li>Ontology editors can completely delete a concept if they are the owner/creator of a concept and have privileges in all the languages of the terms of the concept.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Validator</h3>
The following describes validators' roles and privileges:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Validators are experts that can check and validate in their respective languages the work done by term editors, ontology editors and guests.</li><br>
<li>They validate all proposals and guest proposals and have the power to reject proposals, i.e. remove them again from the model or reset them to their previous state (in case of edits).</li><br>
<li>If a change is validated by validator, its status then needs to be validated by publisher to get a published status.</li><br>
</ul>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Publishers</h3>

The following describes publishers' roles and privileges:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Permission on terms and concepts.</li><br>
<li>Can validate work by editors and confirm validator work.</li><br>
<li>They ultimately approve a validated entry by a validator and change its status to "published".</li><br> 
<li>They can still reject validated entries and thus remove them again from the model (in case of new proposals) or reset them to their previous status (in case of an edit or proposal to delete).</li><br>
<li>Access to all languages.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<!-- ###################################################### -->
<h3>Administrators</h3>
The following describes the roles and privileges of administrators:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Permissions that are included in all user roles.</li><br>
<li>Permission to change manually the status of a concept or a term (for all other users a status will be set by the system automatically based on the action)</li><br>
<li>Can manage users and groups.</li><br>
<li>Can provide statistics.</li><br>
<li>Access to all languages.</li><br>
</ul>
