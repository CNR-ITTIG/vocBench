<h3>Schemes Module</h3>

This module is available from the top of every page. It includes classification schemes.
<br><br>
Use this module to view or work with classification schemes.
<br><br>
<h4>Choosing the scheme to work with</h4>
You can choose which available scheme you wish to view with the drop down menu. By default, the AGRIS/CARIS Classification Scheme is shown.
<br><br>

<h4>Viewing options</h4>

If you have not already done so, you may wish to <b>change which languages you wish to show when viewing the classifications</b> by going to the "Customize Language Display" button available on the top right of every page. Note: this only changes the number of terms you will see in the left panel, or when you are viewing only the classification. You will always see all terms in all languages available in the right panel when you choose a category.
<br><br>
You can also reduce the number of terms shown in the left panel by choosing the option "Show only preferred terms".
<br><br>
You can also choose whether or not to view the URI.
