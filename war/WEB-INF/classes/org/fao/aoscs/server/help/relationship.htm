<h3>Relationships</h3>

<ul>
<li>This part of the AGROVOC-CS Workbench provides management of relationships.</li><br>
<li>It is accessible to guest/non-logged-in users, ontology editors, term editors, validators, administrator, and publishers.</li><br>
<li>Only administrators and publishers are allowed to edit concept relationships.</li><br>
<li>The relationship tree shows the tree view of the relations categorized into Object or Datatype Properties.</li><br>
<li>Object Properties are relationships that link two concepts and describe the semantic relationship between them, i.e. domain or range of the relationship are a concept.</li><br>
<li>Datatype Properties are properties that act more like attributes of a concept, i.e. the range of such a relationship is some datatype, like a simple string, a number, a date or similar.</li><br>
</ul>
<br><br>
The following are instructions to use this module:
<br>
<ol>
<li>To <b>view relationships</b>, choose either Datatype Properties or Object Properties from the drop down menu.</li><br>
<li>To <b>show or hide relationships,</b> click the [+] or [-] sign to expland or collapse the tree.</li><br>
<li>You can choose to <b>hide or show the</b> URI for each relationship by checking or unchecking the "Show URI" box.</li><br>
<li>To <b>add a new relationship</b>, choose a relationship from the tree where you would like to insert a new relationship. Then, click on the [+] or "add" icon next to "Show URI". Enter the name of the new relationship (label) into the text box, select the language of the name of the new relationship and select the position of the new relationship by choosing either "child of the selected relationship" to be a child relationship or "same level as the selected relationship" to be a sibling relationship.</li><br>
<li>To <b>delete a relationship</b>, click on a relationship and click on the delete icon next to "Show URI" (the icon with [-]). Confirm the action to delete.</li><br>
</ol>
<br><br>
The following information can be added, edited or deleted using the tabs on the right when a relationship is chosen:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Labels</li><br>
<li>Definitions</li><br>
<li>Properties</li><br>
