<h3>Glossary</h3>

<h4>Preferred terms</h4>
A preferred term is also known as a descriptor in AGROVOC. It is the recommended term to be used in indexing. 
<br><br>
When you view the translated terms of a term in the Workbench, you are viewing all the preferred terms in the translated languages.
<br>

<h4>Child concept</h4>
A child concept is also known as a narrower concept. It represents a concept narrower in scope than its parent concept and that is subordinate to one or more broader concepts in a hierarchy. 
<br><br>
Examples are:
<br><ul>
<li><i>Farm income</i> is a child or narrower concept of <i>Income</i></li><br>
<li><i>Carrots</i> are a child or narrower concept of <i>Vegetables</i></li><br>
</ul><br>
<br>

<h4>Siblings</h4>
Siblings are one of two or more terms with the same immediate broader term. They have a non-hierarchical relationships between them.
<br><bR>
An example is that <i>Tubers</i> and <i>Yams</i> are both siblings with the parent term <i>Vegetables</i> in AGROVOC.
<br>

<h4>URI</h4>
<b>URI stands for</b> <b>U</b>niform <b>R</b>esource <b>I</b>dentifier. 
<br><br>
A URI in the Workbench is used as a unique identifier for a concept or category that allows another application to access it.
<br>

<h4>Sub-vocabulary</h4>
A sub-vocabulary is a subset of the ontology.
<br><bR>
Examples of sub-vocabularies in the workbench are:
<br><ul>
<li>Geographic concepts at country level</li><br> 
<li>Geographic concept below country level</li><br>
<li>Taxonomic terms</li><br>
<li>Chemical terms</li><br>
</ul><br>



<h4>Concept</h4>
By "concept" we mean "a general statement or an idea" which can be represented with many words, in many languages, with images, etc.
<br><br>
A concept is represented by all the terms, preferred and non-preferred, in all languages, associated with it. Therefore, the entire representation of a concept often includes many terms. 
<br><br>
For example, the English term "Foods" is associated with the concept that also includes the terms, "Foodstuffs" and "Food products", and all the equivalent terms in all languages. 
<br><br>
Another example is:
<br><ul>
<li>a concept is the idea of an organization</li><br>
<li>many terms may represent this concept: "organization", "organisation", "organizações ", "org.", "agency", "ag.", etc.</li><br>
</ul><br>
When a concept is chosen in the Workbench, it is shown on the left and it’s associated terms and information are shown on the right.
<br>

<h4>Term</h4>
"Term" in the Workbench means "a word (simple term), multiword expression (complex term), symbol or formula that designates a particular concept within a given subject field".
<br><br>
For example:
<br><ul>
<li>a concept is the idea of an organization</li><br>
<li>many terms may represent this concept: "organization", "organisation", "organizações ", "org.", "agency", "ag.", etc.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>
To see all the terms associated with a concept, select a concept. You will see the concept shown on the left. All it’s associated terms are shown on the right under the “Terms” tab.
<br>

<h4>Schemes</h4>
Schemes and Classifications are used inter-changeably in the Workbench.
<br><br>
They are an organized structure for arranging or classifying information.
<br><br>
Schemes and classifications are often made up of broad level categories, such as the AGRIS Classification Scheme.
<br><br>

<h4>Non-preferred terms</h4>
Non-preferred terms are also known as synonyms or non-descriptors and are recommended to not be used for indexing. 
<br><br>
In the Workbench, both non-preferred terms and preferred terms are used to represent a concept.
<br><br>

<h4>Ontology</h4>
An ontology is a vocabulary used to describe concepts within an area of knowledge and the relationships between them. It has many similarities with thesauri, but allows for more extensive and richer relationships between concepts. It therefore has much greater potential to be understood by computers as well as humans and is a more powerful tool in managing knowledge and information.
