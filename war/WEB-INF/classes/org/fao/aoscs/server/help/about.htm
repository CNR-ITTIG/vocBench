<h4>Getting started</h4>

The AGROVOC workbench is the tool used to manage concepts, terms, schemes, and relationships between them in AGROVOC. For more information, read the About section.<br><br>The Workbench is largely structured around concepts and terms.<br><br>
Depending on your user role and privileges, you will be able to perform different actions in the Workbench.<br><br>
From the home page, you can see recent proposed or accepted changes.<br><br>
By default, concepts appear in the same language version of the interface you have chosen. You may wish to change the language display during your use of the Workbench.

<h4>Language display</h4>

The interface - the information you see that does not include concepts, terms and relationships - is currently only available in English. <br><br>
More languages will be available soon and they will be available from the top of every page. <br><br>
You can choose which languages you would like to see terms and concepts displayed by selecting the "Customize language display" button at the top of every page.
