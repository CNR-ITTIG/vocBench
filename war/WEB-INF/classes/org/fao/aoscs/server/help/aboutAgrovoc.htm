<h3>About the AGROVOC Concept Server Workbench</h3>

<h4>The AGROVOC Concept Server (CS) Workbench and the FAO Agriculture Ontology Service Initiative</h4>

The AGROVOC Concept Workbench is part of the larger <a target="agrovoc" href="http://www.fao.org/aims/aos.jsp">Agricultural Ontology Service (AOS) initiative</a> and is the first major step towards an "Ontology Service".
<br><br>
"Ontology" is a new technology for representing knowledge that is emerging from various Semantic Web initiatives that will greatly increase our ability to locate and manage information. It is used to describe concepts within an area of knowledge and the relationships between them. It has many similarities with thesauri, but among other features, also allows for more extensive and richer relationships between concepts. It therefore has much greater potential to be understood by computers as well as humans and is a much more powerful tool to manage and represent knowledge and information in the agricultural domain. 
<br><br>
<h4>Evolving AGROVOC from a thesaurus to an ontology</h4>

Using the existing AGROVOC Multilingual thesaurus, the AGROVOC Concept Server builds on AGROVOC data by distinguishing between terms and concepts, which are currently not well separated in the AGROVOC thesaurus. Specific relationships at concept and term level have been identified, which will create a more clear and significant representation of knowledge in the agricultural domain and begin to evolve AGROVOC from a thesaurus to an ontology. The Workbench also contains the possibility to create many new types of relationships between concepts that are not available in the AGROVOC thesaurus.

<h4>Management of the Concept Server Workbench</h4> 

The AGROVOC Concept Server Workbench is the tool that supports the maintenance of the Concept Server data by allowing users to add, edit, and delete terms and concepts and create relationships between them. All users are allowed to create, edit and delete concepts, terms and relationships. Depending on their user role and privileges, their actions will either be implemented or reviewed by validators and administrators.

<h4>Purpose and goals of the Workbench</h4>

The purpose of the Workbench is to further the goals of the Agricultural Ontology Service (AOS). These goals include:
<ul>
<li>the development of a richer indexing tool for information resources in the agricultural and related domains;</li><br>
<li>a representation of knowledge in the agricultural and related domains through concepts and their relationships with each other;</li><br>
<li>increased understanding of knowledge and information in agricultural and related domains by computers. This has tremendous potential for improvement in searching and sharing data.</li><br>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Partnership</h4>

The Workbench is under development by FAO in collaboration with Agricultural Ontology Service partners, mainly the <a target="agrovoc" href="http://www.ku.ac.th/">Kasetsart University</a>, Bangkok, Prof. Dagobert Soergel, University of Maryland, and the <a target="agrovoc" href="http://www.icrisat.org/">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</a>, India (for the revision of the AGROVOC content to suit the Workbench).
