<h3>Search</h3>

The Search Module allows you to search for concepts, relationships, terms and other information associated with concepts. 
<br><br>
The following information is information for the default search page. For more options, see the page for advanced search.
<br><br>
By default, only published terms are searched. If you wish to search for terms with a different status (such as proposed, revised, deleted, etc), use the advanced search.
<BR>
<ol>
<li>Type one or more words or a phrase that best describe the information you want to find into the search box.</li>
<li>Select one of the following search filters from the dropdown list on the left:</li><BR>
	<ul>
	<li><B>'Contains'</B> will list all the concepts with terms containing the search term anywhere, 
	even within another term, e.g. searching for 'rice' with the filter 'contains' will also return 
	'Agricultural prices' and 'Cricetus'.</li><BR>
	<li><B>'Exact match'</B> will list only concepts with terms that exactly match the search term. 
	This choice brings back fewer results than the other choices. Searching 'rice' will ONLY return 
	the concept rice and will exclude 'rice cakes', 'rice flour', 'rice fields', etc.</li><BR>
	<li><B>'Starts with'</B> will list all the concepts that start with the search term you have entered. 
	Searching 'rice' will show you 'rice cakes', 'rice flour', 'rice fields', etc, but not 'wild rice' or 
	'flooded rice'.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
