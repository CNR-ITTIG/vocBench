<div>[ Non logged-in Users] </div>
<ul>
<li>can navigate or search the system.</li>
<li>can submit suggested terms in any language.</li>
<li>can also do other kind of suggestions on concepts and relationships. </li>
<li>all suggestions made by these users should be associated with their IP address.</li>
<li>all suggestions will be identified as �guest proposed� and will be assesed by an&nbsp;authorized and registered validator.</li>
<li>guest proposals will be visible as such in the system. This does not hold for proposed&nbsp;deletions or edits of already existing terms and concepts. Such edits will only show&nbsp;up upon successful validation of a validator. </li></ul>
<div>[Term editors (Terminologist/Thesaurus Editor)]</div>
<ul>
<li>have full permissions on terms. which they own (i.e. created themselves).</li>
<li>this means that any changes on terms which they own (deleting or editing)</li>
<li>will be published without additional validation through a validator. </li>
<li>any other changes will be proposals that need to be validated.</li>
<li>if a term editor creates a new term in his language, this will be published without&nbsp;additional validation</li>
<li>cannot do concepts modifications. </li>
<li>concept modifications and modifications on terms which they are not the owner of&nbsp;will be set only as &quot;proposed�. </li>
<li>every editor has set one or more languages and can add/edit/delete only terms of that&nbsp;Language (for other languages edit access should be prohibited).</li>
<li>can provide suggestions to more experienced users (e.g. concepts modifications that&nbsp;will&nbsp; be processed by Ontology editors).</li>
<li>term editors who are the owner/creators of a term, can delete it completely;</li></ul>
<div>[Ontology Editors (more experienced Terminologist/Thesaurus Editor)] </div>
<ul>
<li>are Terminologist/Thesaurus Editor who know more about ontologies and the&nbsp;distincion of concepts and terms .</li>
<li>can manage terms (of specific languages, i.e. the ontolgoy editors registered&nbsp;languages) and concepts. </li>
<li>if an ontology editor creates a new concept, it will be published without further&nbsp;validation. </li>
<li>only edits on concepts of which the ontology editor is not the owner will enter&nbsp;the system as proposal and will have to be validated.&nbsp;</li>
<li>if an ontology editor deletes a concept, only the terms of the corresponding&nbsp;languages will be set to �proposed deprecated� and the concept status will be set&nbsp;to �proposed deprecated�.</li>
<li>can completely delete the concept, if the ontology editor is the owner/creator of the&nbsp;concept and and only if he has privileges in all the languages of the terms of the concept.</li></ul>
<div>[Validator] </div>
<ul>
<li>are experts that can check and validate in their respective languages the work done&nbsp;by the editors (terms and ontology editors) and guests. </li>
<li>they validate all proposals and guest proposals and have the power to reject proposals,&nbsp;i.e. remove them again from the model or reset them to their previous state (in case of edits)<br>
</li></ul>
<div>[Publisher (Ontology Editors)]</div>
<ul>
<li>have permission on terms and concepts.</li>
<li>can validate editors and confirm validator work.</li>
<li>they ultimately approve a validated entry and change its status to &quot;published&quot; </li>
<li>they can still reject validated entries and thus remove them again from the model&nbsp;(in case of new proposals) or reset them to their previous status&nbsp;(in case of an edit or delete proposal).</li>
<li>access to all languages.<br>
</li></ul>
<div>[Administrators] </div>
<ul>
<li>have all the above permission.</li>
<li>have the permission to change manually the status of a concept or a term (for all other users a status will be set by the system automatically based on the action)</li>
<li>can manage users and groups. </li>
<li>can provide statistics.</li>
<li>access to all languages.</li></ul>
