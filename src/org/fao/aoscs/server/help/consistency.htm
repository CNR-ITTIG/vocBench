<h4>Consistency</h4>

The Consistency Check Module allows editors and contributors to <b>check the validity and the quality of the concept server data</b>.
<br><br>
This module <b>does not change data in the Workbench</b>. The user checking the data decides if action should be taken on the data or not.
<br><br>
By clicking the arrow of the drop-down menu you can select the different types of consistency checks.
<br><br>
Some examples of consistency checks may include:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Identification of concepts which may be <b>children of deprecated concepts</b>.</li><br>
<li>Identification of <b>concepts in the same hierarchy that do not also have associative relationships</b> between them.</li><br>
<li>Verification of <b>concepts which may have the same label</b> in a particular language. This identifies problems such as reuse of a label as a non-preferred term and also as a preferred term, or same label as preferred term for two concepts (in this case the user may decide to rename one).</li><br>
<li>Verification on <b>terms which do not have relationships</b>: this may identify missing relationships</li><br>
<li>Verification of the status which may include:
    <ol>
    <li>List of concepts already approved (published and validated) which have not been lexicalized in a particular language: this will identify possible missing translations.</li><br>
    <li>List concepts which do not have relationships: this may identify missing relationships</li><br>
    <li>List of unused relationships: this can help verify if a relationship is not applied or should just be removed as non pertinent to the selected domain.</li><br>
    </ol>
</li><br>
</ul>
