<h3>Validation Module</h3>
This module is available to administrators, publishers and validators. 
<br><br>
This module is used to validate suggestions for concepts, terms, and relationships made by term editors, ontology experts or non-logged in users suggestions.
<br><br>
Using this module
<br>
<ul>
<li>Changes requiring validation can be viewed from the home page of this module. If nothing is viewed when loading the Validation Module, there is currently no data to be validated.</li><br>
<li>Click on the change to view it within the concept tree. You may find it helpful to open up two browser windows, one to view the Validation Module, and one to view the changes within the Concept Tree.</li><br>
<li>You can accept or reject the item you are viewing by clicking "Accept" or "Reject" in the far right column.</li><br>
<li>If you click "Accept", you will then see the status changed to published. Clicking "Reject" will show the status of the change as "Deleted".</li><br>
<li>If you wish to change Approved to Rejected, or vice versa, you must unclick your original choice.</li><br>
<li>When you reject a change, you can write a reason for rejecting the change in the "Notes" field.</li><br>
<li>If the concept is validated by validator, its status is validated and then needs to be validated by publisher to get a published status. If a publisher directly validates the a change, its status will be directly be changed to published.</li><br>
</ul><br>
